# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project




## About

This machine learning project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using supervised learning algorithms. The analysis implements and compares two different classification models - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees - while exploring the impact of feature scaling on model performance.

### Key Features:
- Comprehensive data analysis of Titanic passenger data
- Implementation of KNN and Decision Tree classifiers
- Comparison of model performance with and without feature scaling
- Detailed visualization of survival patterns based on passenger characteristics
- Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV

The project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, model selection, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. Created as part of the Machine Learning course curriculum, it provides insights into real-world application of classification algorithms using the famous Titanic dataset.
